# Knapsack-Solver
The Knapsack Problem is an optimization problem in operations research. It involves selecting a subset of items, each with a given weight and value, to maximize the total value while staying within a specified weight limit.
This project aims to implement various algorithms to solve the Knapsack Problem and provide a user-friendly web interface to interact with these algorithms.

# Algorithm Implementation:
Develop and implement multiple algorithms to solve the Knapsack Problem, such as:

- Brute Force Algorithm: Explores all possible combinations to find the optimal solution.
- Greedy Algorithm: Uses a heuristic approach to provide a quick, though not always optimal, solution.
- Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up): Utilizes a tabular method to build up the solution incrementally.
- Dynamic Programming (Top-Down): Uses memoization to solve subproblems recursively and store results for efficiency.
- Frontend Development: Create a visually appealing and user-friendly web interface that allows users to input data, select algorithms, and view results. 
- Performance Evaluation: Compare the performance of different algorithms in terms of execution time and accuracy.

# Conclusion
Implemented Knapsack problem solutions (DP, greedy, brute-force) in Python, integrated into a user-friendly website using HTML, CSS, and Flask. Developed proficiency in algorithmic problem-solving, Python programming, web development, and optimization techniques. A comparative analysis revealed dynamic programming's superior efficiency for larger instances, greedy algorithms' speed and simplicity, and brute-force algorithms' impracticality for larger problem sizes due to exponential time complexity.
